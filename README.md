ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Pawan, a curious mind diving into the exciting worlds of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.

I'm currently on a learning journey, building my skills through hands-on projects and comprehensive online courses. Here's a glimpse of what I've been up to:

**Python Prowess (Still Leveling Up!):**

I've covered a solid range of Python fundamentals and intermediate concepts, including:

*   **Beginner Basics:** Variables, data types, string manipulation, input/output, conditionals (if/elif/else), loops (for and while), functions, error handling, and working with random numbers.
*   **Intermediate Adventures:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, methods, inheritance, file I/O (reading and writing to local files, CSVs), using external modules, working with lists and dictionaries (including nested ones!), list and dictionary comprehensions, debugging techniques, and managing scope.
*   **Intermediate + Explorations:**  Venturing into APIs (making HTTP requests with the `requests` module, handling parameters and authentication, sending SMS), web scraping with Beautiful Soup, working with JSON data, local data persistence, sending emails with Python, and handling dates and times. I even got a taste of creating simple desktop apps with Tkinter and deploying Python code online with PythonAnywhere.

**Web Development Wanderings (Almost There!):**

My web development journey has taken me through the core technologies and beyond:

*   **HTML 5:**  Structuring websites with proper syntax, understanding the HTML boilerplate, creating multi-page sites, and following best practices.
*   **CSS 3:** Styling websites using selectors and properties, working with inline, internal, and external CSS, understanding the Box Model, CSS positioning and display, font styling, and implementing responsiveness with media queries.
*   **Flexbox & Grid:** Mastering these powerful CSS layout tools to create flexible and complex website structures.
*   **Bootstrap:** Utilizing this framework to quickly build beautiful, mobile-first websites with its layout system and pre-built components.
*   **Web Design Fundamentals:** Grasping the principles of UI and UX, color theory, modern typography, and managing user attention.
*   **Document Object Model (DOM):** Learning to manipulate HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
*   **JavaScript ES6:** Covering the basics like syntax, data types, operators, control structures, functions (including arrow and higher-order functions), arrays and their methods, object-oriented programming with classes, and manipulating objects and arrays.
*   **React.js:**  Exploring front-end development with React, working with components, props, JSX, state management, and React Hooks.
*   **The Unix Command Line:** Getting comfortable with basic bash commands for file and folder manipulation.
*   **Git, GitHub, and Version Control:** Using Git for version control, branching, forking, cloning, and collaborating with GitHub.
*   **Node.js & Express.js:**  Delving into back-end development with server-side JavaScript, creating Node and Express servers, understanding RESTful routing and middleware.
*   **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** Understanding how APIs work, making calls, reading documentation, basic authentication, and working with JSON and XML.
*   **EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates):** Using EJS for templating with Node and Express to create dynamic web pages.
*   **Database Fundamentals:** Understanding data relationships, designing data models, and exploring relational and alternative databases.
*   **SQL Databases & PostgreSQL:** Working with database schemas, performing CRUD operations, database joins, and implementing different relationship types in PostgreSQL using Node.js.
*   **Deployment:** Understanding hosting and deployment, deploying static websites with GitHub Pages, server-based applications with Heroku, and databases with Mongo Atlas.
*   **Building RESTful APIs:** Implementing API design principles and creating public APIs from scratch.
*   **Authentication and Security:** Learning about user authentication, encryption, hashing and salting with bcrypt, using sessions and cookies, setting up local authentication, and implementing OAuth 2.0 with Google.

**Machine Learning and Data Science (Just Getting Started!):**

My journey into ML and Data Science is in its early stages, but I've started with:

*   **Introduction to Regression and the Linear Data Science Workflow:** Learning to specify problems, clean data with Pandas, visualize data with Matplotlib, understanding Linear Regression theory, estimating coefficients with scikit-learn, making predictions, and evaluating model results.
*   **Introduction to Python Programming for Data Science:** Focusing on using variables, data types, Python collections (Lists, NumPy Arrays, Pandas DataFrames, and Series), importing packages, using functions, and working with Python objects.
*   **Optimisation and Gradient Descent:** Understanding how optimization works, the role of Cost Functions, basic calculus concepts (derivatives), and implementing the Gradient Descent algorithm with Python loops and NumPy arrays.
